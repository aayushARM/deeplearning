Machine learning: I have been solving complex problems using different Machine learning (M.L.) algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic regression, SVM, k-means, Radom Forest and Learning to Rank etc. I must say M.L. has come a long way.

Inarguably, my biggest personal achievement so far on endurance scale. The most scariest, hardest, longest and toughest hike I have ever done in my entire life. 

Feeling accomplished after hiking 16 miles, gaining about 4000 feet in elevation from the Yosemite valley and reaching the top of Half dome which is at 8700 feet above sea level.

Thanks for the support for all who shared the journey with me and to those who were unable to.
Thanks to Sumit Vij and Surendra for sharing the journey with me.

Special thanks to Vaishali Bajaj for her support to let me do this hike while she was out injured.

Until the next hike. 

How was your long weekend like?

Continuing from my last post on k-means clustering, in this post I will talk about how to use `Silhouette analysis` for selecting number of clusters for K-means clustering. What is Silhouette analysis (S.A.)?: S.A. is a way to measure how close each point in a cluster is to the points in its neighboring clusters. Its a neat way to find out the optimum value for k during k-means clustering.  [  634 more words. ]

Nice book, has some great chapters. Gives an introduction of what Assholes are in corporate world and how deal with them and how to not become one. But, overall it&#039;s has lots of instances of Assholes in various corporate settings. I hoped the book had more substances. Definitely worth reading once.
Just another Facebook status update to attract attention from fellow women-hood. 
Everything you said is based out of Bollywood and is a symbol of self-denial. 

Yes, me and my wife fast today and we might belong to the minority class. But, we do it to enjoy the old tradition nor to mock it. Before making such statements, are all your statements based out of watching bollywood movies or did you ever made any efforts to read the Upanishad, Gitas and other literary text to really understand the reason behind this tradition of ours. 

An act of self-denial against the the Hindu culture. But, as we all know the religion itself means follow your own dharm(whatever that means to you), But, not make fun of it.

In the post, I will give an introduction to k-means algorithm. For first time readers, k-means is a clustering algorithm which is used to find similar clusters for a set of n elements. Number of clusters `k` required is provided an as input from the user. K-means is an iterative algorithm where the task is to assign each sample to a cluster center such that the distance between the sample and the cluster center is minimized. [  375 more words. ]

Usually, the level of information we display via this technique is embedded in a form of a distance matrix.

An awesome compilation of The Hobbit first edition and revised edition released by Dr J. R. R. Tolkien. In the first edition, Gollum promised to give the ring to Bilbo as a prize of wining the riddle. Whereas, Tolkein had to revise this chapter so that Gollum sounds more treacherous and pity and the ring prize sounds so grandeur. This was done when Tolkein decided to write the The Lord of the Rings Trilogy so that the ring sounds more powerful.

~14 saal baad its time for the Calcutta match revenge. Just like Ram came victorious after 14 years of exile. Seems like thing will fall in place.
The only way India will win the final is if Sachin doesn&#039;t score his 100th 100.
There are only two diff. results for today&#039;s match: India winning or cricket being the final winner. F$&#064;k Pakistan.
Cricket fans, weather can play spoil sports.

You are not my beloved now...
You did not come close to me,
This separation is burning me away,
And it&#039;s crossed all boundaries of endurance,
My heart didn&#039;t get it&#039;s wish,
So leave, you traitor...
I waited years for you,
But you struck lightening on my heart,
You&#039;re hard-hearted and never understood my pain...
But without you the day is merely a shadow of the night,
Without you nothing ever pleases me...
Thanks.. but, No thanks !

Well dear.. Status messages cannot accomplish what other things can&#039;t. There are things much more than just some named streets. Well here&#039;s a thought. Take a look at the first two lines...

http://hitesh-gupta.blogspot.com/2008/07/nazm-iv.html

And you always complain that you never understand any of my couplets.. So here is the meaning

These streets and cities, they cannot breath
The map of my life is drawn with some roads
Well the they are not as sweet.. as they used to be last summer... But Dr B got them for helping me move his stuff.. So after long tiring day.. kind of enjoying them...
Not a fracture .... its a ligament tear ..... :( Need to get some rest and less strain.
Thanks for the wishes though dude ....
